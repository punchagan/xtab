xtab
====

Chrome extension for limiting the total number of tabs you can have open

You can either explicitly set a limit on the number of tabs you want open, or
set a limit on the memory usage of Chrome, and have tabs killed automatically.
The latter requires your browser to support the
[processes](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/processes) API.
